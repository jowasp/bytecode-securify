#Bytecodeviewer clean up 

This isa clean working version of the Bytecodeviewer program
The latest master version contains issues with the POM and dependencies that does not run properly
This version is a fully Java Application without any Maven depencies
Many issues encountered in the Maven dependencies have to do with libraries not being suported by Maven distribution
This version also contains an extra package (XposedGenerator) for generating Xposed Classes extracted from the selected Class methods opened in BytecodeViewer (In Progress)
